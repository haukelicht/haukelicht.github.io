I'm Hauke, a post-doctoral researcher at the [Cologne Center for Comparative Politics](https://cccp.uni-koeln.de/ "Cologne Center of Comparative Politics") of the University of Cologne.

My research focuses on the role that *rhetorical strategies* play in electoral competition, legislative politics, and democratic representation, and I develop and apply *computational text analysis methods* to this end. 
For example, in my dissertation I have examine how political text collections' increasing volume, variety, and granularity can be harnessed to study party competition across countries and languages.

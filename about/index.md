I'm Hauke Licht, a first-year PhD student of Political Science at the University of Zurich and a member of the research group <a href="http://www.ipz.uzh.ch/en/forschung/lehrstuehle/direct-democracy-political-participation.html">Direct Democracy and Political Participation</a>.

Previously, I have studied Political Science and Sociology at the Humboldt University Berlin, and in the joint master's program International Relations of the Freie Universit√§t Berlin, the Humboldt University Berlin and the University of Potsdam.
During my bachelor and master studies, I also spent a term at the University of Uppsala in Sweden and a year at the Political Science Department of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, USA.

I have moreover gained professional experience as a data analyst in the federal election campaign of the Social Democratic Party of Germany in 2017 and as research assistant in two DFG-funded projects at the chair of Comparative Politics of Humboldt University.

I'm Hauke, **_Assistant Professor of Computational Political Science_** at the [Department of Political Science](https://www.uibk.ac.at/en/politikwissenschaft/) and the [Digital Science Center](https://www.uibk.ac.at/en/disc/) of the University of Innsbruck, Austria.

I develop and apply **computational methods** for the comparative study of political communication strategies.
For example, in a [paper](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007123424000954) with Ronja Sczepanski (Sciences Po Paris) in the **_British Journal of Political Science_**, we present a novel, deep learning-based method for extracting mentions of social groups from political texts that has received the **_PolMeth Europe Best Poster Award for Innovative Data Science_** in 2022.
And in a recent paper forthcoming in the **_Proceedings of the 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing_** (EMNLP), my co-authors and I develop and evaluate LLMs in the measurement of scalar socail science constructs, like the negativity of a campaign ad, the level of arousal in a political speech, the intensity of fear and anger expressed in open-ended survy responses.
<!-- In my dissertation, I have examined how the increasing volume, variety, and granularity of political text collections can be harnessed to study party competition across countries and languages. -->

I'm particularly interested in the role of **rhetorical strategies** in democratic representation, electoral competition, and legislative politics.
For example, in a **_Journal of Politics_** [paper](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/730711), Tarik Abou-Chadi, Pablo Barber√°, Whitney Hua, and I apply machine learning methods to Twitter data to investigate how challenger and mainstream parties adapt their anti-elite rhetoric to coalition formation incentives and their standing in the polls.
From 2026 to 2029, I will pursue this research interest in the **third-party funded project _Group Appeals in Parliamentary and Electoral Debates_** that I will co-lead with Lena M. Huber (University of Mannheim).

Another part of my research focuses on **multilingual text analysis** and aims to equip scholars and data analysts with innovative tools for comparing political processes and decisions across diverse contexts and languages.
For example, in my [paper](https://doi.org/10.1017/pan.2022.29) "Cross-Lingual Classification of Political Texts Using Multilingual Sentence Embeddings" published in **_Political Analysis_**, I show how translation-free, state-of-the-art transfer learning strategies can enable reliable cross-lingual political text analysis.
In a [paper](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/9trjs) forthcoming in **_Political Science Research and Methods_**, my co-authors and I validate open-source machine translation models for cross-lingual measurement with computational text analysis methods like topic modeling or transformer classifier fine-tuning.
And in a **_Computational Communication Research_** [paper](https://doi.org/10.5117/CCR2023.2.2.LICH) co-authored with Fabienne Lind (University of Vienna), we provide a guide to multilingual text analysis for political and communication scientists.

I'm a Ph.D. student at the [Department of Political Science](https://www.ipz.uzh.ch/en.html) of the University of Zurich, and member of the research group [Direct Democracy and Political Participation](http://www.ipz.uzh.ch/en/forschung/lehrstuehle/direct-democracy-political-participation.html) since May 2018.

Previously, I have studied [Political Science and Sociology at the Humboldt University Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en/studies/counselling/course-catalogue/programme-descriptions/sowi), 
and in the [joint master's program International Relations](http://www.masterib.de/en/index.html) of the Freie Universit√§t Berlin, the Humboldt University Berlin and the University of Potsdam.
During my bachelor and master studies, I also spent a term at the University of Uppsala in Sweden and a year at the Political Science Department of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, USA.

I have gained professional experience as a data analyst in the federal election campaign of the Social Democratic Party of Germany in 2017, as research assistant in two third-party funded projects at the chair of Comparative Politics of Humboldt University, and as teaching assistant and tutor in the lectures Statistics I and II in the Social Sciences bachelor program of the Humboldt University Berlin.

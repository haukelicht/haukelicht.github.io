I'm a PhD student at the [Department of Political Science](https://www.ipz.uzh.ch/en.html) of the University of Zurich, and member of the research group <a href="http://www.ipz.uzh.ch/en/forschung/lehrstuehle/direct-democracy-political-participation.html">Direct Democracy and Political Participation</a> since May 2018.

Previously, I have studied Political Science and Sociology at the Humboldt University Berlin, and in the joint master's program International Relations of the Freie Universit√§t Berlin, the Humboldt University Berlin and the University of Potsdam.
During my bachelor and master studies, I also spent a term at the University of Uppsala in Sweden and a year at the Political Science Department of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, USA.

I have gained professional experience as a data analyst in the federal election campaign of the Social Democratic Party of Germany in 2017, as research assistant in two DFG-funded projects at the chair of Comparative Politics of Humboldt University, and as tutor in the courses Statistics I and II in the Social Science bachelor program of the Humboldt University Berlin.
